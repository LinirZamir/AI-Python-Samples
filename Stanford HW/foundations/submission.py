"""
You can think of the keys of the defaultdict as representing the positions in
the sparse vector, while the values represent the elements at those positions.
Any key which is absent from the dict means that that element in the sparse
vector is absent (is zero).
Note that the type of the key used should not affect the algorithm. You can
imagine the keys to be integer indices (e.g., 0, 1, 2) in the sparse vectors,
but it should work the same way with arbitrary keys (e.g., "red", "blue", 
"green").

    Given a sentence (sequence of words), return a list of all "similar"
    sentences.
    We define a sentence to be "similar" to the original sentence if
      - it has the same number of words, and
      - each pair of adjacent words in the new sentence also occurs in the
        original sentence (the words within each pair should appear in the same
        order in the output sentence as they did in the original sentence).
    Notes:
      - The order of the sentences you output doesn't matter.
      - You must not output duplicates.
      - Your generated sentence can use a word in the original sentence more
        than once.

      - Input: 'the cat and the mouse'
      - Output: ['and the cat and the', 'the cat and the mouse',
